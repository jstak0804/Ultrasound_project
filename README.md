# Ultrasound_project

Liver Ultrasound Classification Project (Ultrasound_project)This project focuses on the automated classification of liver tumors into benign and malignant categories using deep learning techniques on ultrasound imagery. The core of this research lies in implementing a custom attention mechanism to capture the subtle textures and patterns characteristic of medical ultrasound data.1. Key FeaturesBinary Classification: Specialized in distinguishing between benign and malignant liver lesions.Advanced Attention Mechanism: Integration of a custom parallel attention structure to optimize feature extraction.Modular Architecture: Separated scripts for baseline testing, optimized training, and model definition for easy experimentation.2. Model Architecture (custommodel details)The custommodel in model.py is specifically designed to handle the complexity of medical images through a refined feature-refinement process:Backbone: Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-50 for robust initial feature extraction.Feature Compression: The 2048-channel output from the ResNet backbone is compressed to 1024 channels via a 3x3 convolution to improve computational efficiency.Parallel Attention Structure:Branch A: Sequential processing through a SEBlock followed by ChannelAttention.Branch B: Sequential processing through ChannelAttention followed by a SEBlock.The outputs from both branches are concatenated, restoring the feature map to 2048 channels.Spatial Refinement: A SpatialAttention module is applied to the concatenated features to emphasize relevant spatial regions (e.g., tumor boundaries).Final Output: Global Average Pooling (GAP) followed by a Linear layer to produce the final classification logic.3.
